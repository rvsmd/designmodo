1.  First, let's launch the sample _Designmodo-Siter-io_ app
    bundled with this project to demo some of its best features:

    ```Shell
    npm run setup
    ```

	```Shell
    npm run start
    ```

2.  Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

3.  Let's launch cypress to demo tests:

    ```Shell
    npm run test:ui:ci
    ```

	Secondly, in another terminal tab (Command Prompt):

	 ```Shell
    npm run cypress:open
    ```
